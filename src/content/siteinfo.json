  "aboutText": "Soul Frames was born from a simple belief: that your most precious memories deserve to be celebrated with the same care and love that created them.\n\nWe're not just creating frames; we're crafting vessels for your emotions, your stories, and your heart. Each piece we make is infused with the understanding that what we frame isn't just a photograph â€” it's a moment that made you smile, cry, or changed your life forever.\n\nAs a small, artisan brand, we pour our hearts into every single frame. We work closely with each customer, ensuring that what we create together is as unique and special as the memory it holds."
